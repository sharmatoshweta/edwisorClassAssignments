  <p class="hidden">
    I am die hard soccer fan and a soccer player. That's the only thing i love more than computer and technology. I am also a startup enthusiast and love to help startups. Infact, i do it every weekend as a habit.<br/> I like writing. I used to write a lot during my college time, but for last 2 years, all i have been writing is "Code"! I have finally decided to pick up my "Internet pen" and start writing again and hence this blog.(yes, yes, i have gotten a little rusty).<br/>Professionaly, i am the co-founder and chief technology officer of a really cool startup. As you may have done the math already, i designed the whole frontend and backend of company's product myself and now i have passed the baton to group of really talented developers.(Busy life justified! sigh..) <br>
    In Technology, i am extremely interested in Distributed Systems, Cloud, Scaling in Cloud. I have recently started learning Neo4j which is a very cool graph database with infinite applications in days to come. I am also working on AMQP, InterPlanetary File System(IPFS) and WebRTC and conducting some research of my own. So, if you are looking for - a friend who can help you with those little technical doubts, a mentor for your interns and employees, a technical consultant who associates himself with the concept and people, an expert to scale up your technology architecture or a guy who is a football chatterbox, well you better call this saul.
